## Yonies - Stream and Follow, Together! ##
We’ve been working to develop a totally new type of watch party. We call it Yonies!

Ever tried to watch your favorite creator's latest vid with friends? It's not fun, or easy. That’s why we built Yonies.

We believe in sharing your slice of pop culture with friends. It’s not all about fancy vacations, sushi dinners, or beautiful sunsets. Sometimes it’s an inside joke, a silly face, or talking about the Kardashian's latest pregnancy.

Pop culture is more entertaining when it’s shared with the people who know us best. And we know that no one is better at making us laugh than our friends.

Yonies will be available soon. Happy YoYo!
