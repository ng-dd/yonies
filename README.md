## Yonies - Stream and Follow, Together! ##
We’ve been working to develop a totally new type of watch party. We call it Yonies!

Ever tried to watch your favorite creator's latest vid with friends? It's not fun, or easy. That’s why we built Yonies.

We believe in sharing your slice of pop culture with friends. It’s not all about fancy vacations, sushi dinners, or beautiful sunsets. Sometimes it’s an inside joke, a silly face, or talking about the Kardashian's latest pregnancy.

Pop culture is more entertaining when it’s shared with the people who know us best. And we know that no one is better at making us laugh than our friends.

Yonies will be available soon. 

Happy YoYo!

## Development ##
`npm run dev`: [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) execute Firebase, Angular build, TypeScript compiler, Flask and Express servers.

A window will automatically open at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Angular and Express files are being watched. Any change automatically creates a new bundle, restart Express server and reload your browser.

### Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build

### Production
`npm run prod`: run the project with a production bundle and AOT compilation listening at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) . 
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Tests
### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
